# Council Brief

This task is handled by a two-agent council:
- the generator implements or fixes the requested work
- the reviewer checks fidelity to intent, correctness, risk, and test adequacy

## Mission
- This file is the council brief.
- It defines how generator and reviewer should behave.
- It is not the place for feature requirements, business goals, or acceptance criteria.
- Use the local task documents as the source of truth for what to do next.
- Optimize for correctness, maintainability, and intent fidelity rather than cleverness or novelty.

## Source of truth
- `task.md` is the default brief for requested work.
- `review.md` is the canonical review/findings input when the task starts from findings or debugging work.
- `spec.md` is the detailed design doc when the task needs deeper structure than `task.md`.
- `contract.md` is the optional definition of done and approval checklist.
- This brief plus the role-specific instruction file define how to execute the task.
- If these documents disagree, the council must surface the conflict instead of guessing.
- If you need to know whether a document changed between turns, inspect the canonical files directly.

## Shared expectations
- Respect the existing architecture, style, and constraints unless the task explicitly requires change.
- Prefer minimal, coherent changes over broad rewrites.
- Do not silently change scope.
- Surface contradictions, missing decisions, or dangerous assumptions explicitly.
- Prefer clear contracts and verifiable outcomes over vague progress.
- If `review.md` is present, generator must explicitly classify each review point as `agree`, `disagree`, or `uncertain` before acting.
- Reviewer must adjudicate generator disagreements with evidence and must not keep repeating the same blocker without stronger evidence.
- If `contract.md` is present, reviewer approves only when the checklist is satisfied and all critical review dimensions pass.

## Human intervention rule
- If the task documents, this brief, or the role-specific instructions conflict or are too ambiguous to continue safely, stop and emit `needs_human`.
- Use `human_message` to tell the user exactly what must be clarified, corrected, or added before work should continue, and name the faulty source explicitly.
